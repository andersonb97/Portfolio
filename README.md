# Portfolio

The purpose of this portfolio is to showcase some of the projects that I have worked on and 
the variety of skills that I have aquired through the process.

Diamonds Regression -- This is a regression analysis that I preformed based off a Kaggle
dataset. The Diamonds dataset contains approximately 54,000 observations. A teammate and I
worked through a multiple regression analysis involving exploritory data analysis, checking
regression assumptions, data transformation, and predictions regarding the data. It is a good
example of my ability to preform meta-regression and my understanding of multiple statistical
concepts.

Monopoly -- I had the idea for this project after we simulated a simple children's game in 
one of my classes. It is a simulation of the game monopoly and is designed to flesh out the
best strategies for the game of monopoly. It involves multiple multi-level functions used to
simulate various stages of game play. In its current state each players game strategy is 
based off a player comfort level randomly assigned to each player at the beginning of the game.
The Monopoly Analysis file contains various insites into the game of monopoly including which
player is the most likely to win depending on what order they begin the game play in, what 
player comfort level is most appropriate, which properties are the most profitable, etc.
