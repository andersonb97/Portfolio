# Portfolio

The purpose of this portfolio is to showcase some of the projects that I have worked on and 
the variety of skills that I have aquired through the process.

Stock Prediction using NLP -- This folder contains one of my school projects. It not only
includes a Jupyter notebook with all of my code for making predictions in regarding stock 
price changes, it also contains an example of techincal writing with a literature review that
I performed on the same topic. In the notebooks in this folder I use the Twitter API to pull
tweets regarding the S&P 500. In addition, this contains a scrape that I did getting recent 
stock data from Yahoo! Finance. Finally, in my analysis notebook I perform a sentiment analysis 
on tweets and a semantic analysis using TFIDF scores. Based off these metrics I try logistic
regression analysis, multinomial naive bayes, and random forest analyses.

Diamonds Regression -- This is a regression analysis that I preformed based off a Kaggle
dataset. The Diamonds dataset contains approximately 54,000 observations. A teammate and I
worked through a multiple regression analysis involving exploritory data analysis, checking
regression assumptions, data transformation, and predictions regarding the data. It is a good
example of my ability to preform meta-regression and my understanding of multiple statistical
concepts.

Monopoly -- I had the idea for this project after we simulated a simple children's game in 
one of my classes. It is a simulation of the game monopoly and is designed to flesh out the
best strategies for the game of monopoly. It involves multiple multi-level functions used to
simulate various stages of game play. In its current state each players game strategy is 
based off a player comfort level randomly assigned to each player at the beginning of the game.
The Monopoly Analysis file contains various insites into the game of monopoly including which
player is the most likely to win depending on what order they begin the game play in, what 
player comfort level is most appropriate, which properties are the most profitable, etc.

Sales Forecast Time Series -- This is a Kaggle competition that I did for a class. It is a
fairly straight forward time series problem that includes three months predictions in the 
future for different items in 10 different stores. The Kaggle competition scores the predictions
on a SMAPE scale. The code that I have here recieved a SMAPe score of 14.3 which is very 
competative in the competition. To perform the analysis, I used a gradient boosted model in the
'Caret' package in R and it includes brief data cleaning, data exploration, and factor 
engineering.
